# Tabby cat

A **tabby cat**, or simply **tabby**, is any [domestic
cat](domestic_cat "wikilink") (*Felis catus*) with a distinctive
M-shaped marking on their forehead, stripes by their eyes and across
their cheeks, along their back, around their legs and tail, and
characteristic striped, dotted, lined, flecked, banded, or swirled
patterns on the body: neck, shoulders, sides, flanks, chest, and
abdomen. The four known distinct patterns, each having a sound genetic
explanation, are the mackerel, classic or blotched, ticked, and spotted
tabby patterns.

"Tabby" is not a [breed of cat](Cat_breeds "wikilink") but a coat
pattern found in many official cat breeds. It is very common among the
[general population of mixed-breed
cats](Domestic_short-haired_cat "wikilink") around the world. The
tabby pattern occurs naturally and is connected both to the coat of the
domestic cat's direct ancestor and to those of their close relatives:
the [African wildcat](African_wildcat "wikilink") (*Felis lybica
lybica*), the [European wildcat](European_wildcat "wikilink") (*Felis
silvestris*) and the [Asiatic wildcat](Asiatic_wildcat "wikilink")
(*Felis lybica ornata*), all of which have similar coats, both by
pattern and coloration. One genetic study of domestic cats found at
least five founders.

## Etymology

The English term *tabby* originally referred to "striped silk
[taffeta](taffeta "wikilink")", from the
[French](French_language "wikilink") word *tabis*, meaning "a rich
watered [silk](silk "wikilink")". This can be further traced to the
[Middle French](Middle_French "wikilink") *atabis* (14th century), which
stemmed from the [Arabic](Arabic "wikilink") term عتابية /
*ʿattābiyya*. This word is a reference to the Attabiya district of
[Baghdad](Baghdad "wikilink"), noted for its striped cloth and silk;
itself named after the [Umayyad](Umayyad "wikilink") governor of
[Mecca](Mecca "wikilink") [Attab ibn Asid](Attab_ibn_Asid "wikilink").
Such silk cloth became popular in the [Muslim
world](Muslim_world "wikilink") and spread to England, where the word
"tabby" became commonly used in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Use of the term *tabby cat* for a cat with a striped coat began in the
1690s, and was shortened to *tabby* in 1774. The notion that tabby
indicates a female cat may be due to the feminine proper name Tabby as a
[nickname](nickname "wikilink") of "[Tabitha](Tabitha "wikilink")".

## Patterns

The four known distinct patterns, each having a sound genetic
explanation, are the mackerel, classic, ticked, and spotted tabby
patterns.

A fifth pattern is formed by any of the four basic patterns being
included as part of a patched pattern. A patched tabby is a cat with
[calico](Calico_cat "wikilink") or
[tortoiseshell](Tortoiseshell_cat "wikilink") markings combined with
patches of tabby coat (such cats are called caliby and torbie,
respectively, in [cat fancy](Animal_fancy "wikilink")).

All five patterns have been observed in random-bred populations. Several
additional patterns are found in specific breeds and so are not as well
known. For example, a modified classic tabby is found in the
[Sokoke](Sokoke "wikilink") breed. Some of these rarer patterns are
because of the interaction of wild and domestic genes, as with the
rosette and marbled patterns found in the
[Bengal](Bengal_(cat) "wikilink") breed.

### Mackerel (striped) tabby

The mackerel, or striped, tabby pattern is made up of thin vertical,
gently curving stripes on the sides of the body. These stripes can be
continuous or broken into bars and short segments/spots, especially on
the flanks and stomach. Three or five vertical lines in an "M" shape
almost always appear on the forehead, along with dark lines from the
corners of the eyes, one or more crossing each cheek, and of course many
stripes and lines at various angles on the neck and shoulder area, on
the flanks, and around the legs and tail, marks which are more or less
perpendicular to the length of the body part. Mackerel tabbies are also
called 'fishbone tabbies,' probably doubly named after the
[mackerel](mackerel "wikilink") fish. Mackerels are the most common
among tabbies.

### Classic (blotched) tabby

The classic tabby, also known as blotched tabby, has the 'M' pattern on
the forehead but, rather than primarily thin stripes or spots, the body
markings are thick curving bands in whorls or a swirled pattern, with a
distinctive mark on each side of the body resembling a bullseye. 80% of
modern-day cats have the recessive allele responsible for the classic
pattern. Black tabbies generally have dark browns, olives, and
ochres that stand out more against their black colors. Classic tabbies
each have a light-colored "butterfly" pattern on the shoulders and three
thin stripes (the center stripe being the darkest) running along the
spine. The legs, tail, and cheeks of a classic tabby have thick stripes,
bands, and/or bars. The gene responsible for the coloring of a classic
tabby is [recessive](Dominance_(genetics) "wikilink"). Many
[American shorthair cats](American_Shorthair "wikilink") demonstrate
this pattern.

### Ticked tabby

The ticked tabby pattern is due to even fields of
[agouti](Agouti_(coloration) "wikilink") hairs, each with distinct bands
of color, which break up the tabby patterning into a salt-and-pepper
appearance that makes them look sand-like—thus there are few to no
stripes or bands. Residual ghost striping and/or barring can often be
seen on the lower legs, face, and belly and sometimes at the tail tip,
as well as the standard 'M' and a long dark line running along the
spine, primarily in ticked tabbies that also carry a mackerel or classic
tabby allele. These types of cats come in many forms and colors.

### Spotted tabby

It's thought that the spotted tabby results from a modifier gene that
breaks up the mackerel tabby pattern and causes the stripes to appear as
spots. Similarly, the classic tabby pattern may be broken by the spotted
tabby gene into large spots. One can see both large and small spot
patterns in the [Australian Mist](Australian_Mist "wikilink"),
[Bengal](Bengal_cat "wikilink"), [Serengeti](Serengeti_cat "wikilink"),
[Savannah](Savannah_cat "wikilink"), [Egyptian
Mau](Egyptian_Mau "wikilink"), [Arabian Mau](Arabian_Mau "wikilink"),
[Maine Coon](Maine_Coon "wikilink"), and [Ocicat](Ocicat "wikilink")
breeds, among others, as well as some crosses. Naturally, the most
common spotted tabby looks most similar to the mackerel tabby, including
the classic marks on the limbs, tail, and head, as well as the 'M' on
the forehead.

### Orange tabby

The orange tabby, also commonly called red or ginger tabby, is a
color-variant of the above patterns, having
[pheomelanin](Melanin "wikilink") (O [allele](allele "wikilink"))
instead of [eumelanin](eumelanin "wikilink") (o allele). Though
generally a mix of orange and white, the ratio between fur color varies,
from a few orange spots on the back of a white cat to a completely
orange coloring with no white at all. The orange areas can be darker or
lighter spots or stripes, but the white is nearly always solid and
usually appears on the underbelly, paws, chest, and muzzle.

The face markings are reminiscent of the mackerel or classic tabby and,
with orange/white, inclusion of a white spot on the face that covers the
mouth, coming to a point around the forehead. Because a masking gene is
present on white fur, its inclusion is often
[asymmetrical](Asymmetry "wikilink"), leading to more or less white fur
on each paw or side of the face.

About 80% of orange tabby cats are male. The orange coloring is a
gene, found on the X [chromosome](chromosome "wikilink"). Females have
XX chromosomes to the male's XY. Thus, both the mother and father cat
must pass on the genes to the female, but males only need the trait from
their mothers.

### Torbies and calibies

Since female cats have two X chromosomes, it is possible for them to
have the O (orange) allele on one X chromosome and o (black) on the
other. This causes both colors to appear in random patches, either with
or without the tabby pattern. When paired with the tabby pattern, these
cats are known as **torbie cats**. If there is also [white
spotting](Cat_coat_genetics#White_spotting_and_epistatic_white "wikilink"),
the cat is known as a **caliby** (US English).

## Genetic explanations

Two distinct gene loci, the agouti gene locus (two alleles) and the
tabby locus (three alleles), and one modifier, spotted (two alleles),
cause the four basic tabby patterns. The fifth pattern is emergent,
being expressed by female cats with one black and one orange gene on
each of their two X chromosomes, and is explained by Barr bodies and the
genetics of sex-linked inheritance.

The [agouti gene](agouti_gene "wikilink"), with its two alleles, *A* and
*a*, controls whether or not the tabby pattern is expressed. The
dominant *A* expresses the underlying tabby pattern, while the recessive
non-agouti or "hyper-melanistic" allele, *a*, does not. Solid-color
(black or blue) cats have the *aa* combination, hiding the tabby
pattern, although sometimes a suggestion of the underlying pattern can
be seen ("ghost striping"). This underlying pattern, whether classic,
mackerel, ticked or spotted, is most easily distinguishable under bright
light in the early stages of kittenhood and on the tail in adulthood.

However, the agouti gene primarily controls the production of black
pigment, so a cat with an *O* allele for orange color will still express
the tabby pattern. As a result, both red cats and the patches of red on
tortoiseshell cats will always show tabby patterning, though sometimes
the stripes are muted—especially in cream and blue/cream cats due to the
pigment dilution.

The mackerel pattern and its *T<sup>m</sup>* allele at the tabby gene
locus is dominant over the classic (or blotched) allele,
*T<sup>b</sup>*. So a cat with a *T<sup>m</sup>T<sup>m</sup>* or
*T<sup>m</sup>T<sup>b</sup>* genotype sets the basic pattern of thin
stripes (mackerel tabby) that underlies the coat, while a
*T<sup>b</sup>T<sup>b</sup>* cat will express a classic tabby coat
pattern with thick bands and a ring or concentric stripes on its sides.

The ticked tabby pattern is a result of a different allele at the same
gene locus as the mackerel and classic tabby patterns and this allele is
dominant over the others. So a *T<sup>a</sup>T<sup>a</sup>* genotype as
well as *T<sup>a</sup>T<sup>m</sup>* and *T<sup>a</sup>T<sup>b</sup>*
genotypes will be ticked tabbies. The ticked tabby coat essentially
masks any other tabby pattern, producing a non-patterned, or agouti
tabby (much like the wild type agouti coat of many other mammals and the
sable coat of dogs), with virtually no stripes or bars. If the ticked
allele is present, no other tabby pattern will be expressed. The ticked
allele actually shows incomplete dominance: cats homozygous for the
ticked allele (*T<sup>a</sup>T<sup>a</sup>*) have less barring than cats
heterozygous for the ticked allele (*T<sup>a</sup>T<sup>m</sup>* or
*T<sup>a</sup>T<sup>b</sup>*).

The spotted gene is a separate locus theorized to be directly connected
to the *T<sup>m</sup>* allele; it 'breaks' the lines and thin stripes of
a mackerel tabby, creating spots. The spotted gene has a dominant and a
recessive allele as well, which means a spotted cat will have an *Sp Sp*
or *Sp sp* genotype along with at least one *T<sup>m</sup>* allele and
at least one *A* allele at those alleles’ respective loci.

## Temperament

Personality and aggression vary widely from cat to cat, and is
multifactorial. A 2015 study from [University of California,
Davis](University_of_California,_Davis "wikilink") sought to examine the
relationship between coat color and behavior in cats. Researchers
ran statistical analyses from 1,274 online surveys completed by cat
owners. The owners were asked to rank the cats' aggressiveness during
interactions with human aggression, handling aggression, and veterinary
aggression. The study concluded that, though aggressive behaviors did
show up in different levels between different coats, these were
relatively minor. The larger differences in aggression seemed to
researchers to be sex-linked, rather than related to any coat pattern or
coloring:

    With all coat colors combined, females were identified by their guardians as more aggressive during veterinary visits compared with males (X² = 10.36, p = .001). Analyses showed that gray-and-white and black/brown/gray tabby females were more aggressive than their male counterparts at veterinarians’ offices (X² = 9.28, p = .002, and X² = 5.00, p = .025, respectively).

A similar study also reported no evidence of a link between a cat's
behavior and their coat pattern; however, it suggested that any
differences were just how they were being perceived, i.e. people
perceive orange cats as "friendly" and white cats as "shy", and then
look for confirmation of these perceptions.

## History

Since the tabby pattern is a common wild type, it might be assumed that
medieval cats were tabbies. However, one writer believed this to be
untrue, at least in England. Sometime after the mid-17th century, the
[natural philosopher](natural_philosopher "wikilink") [John
Aubrey](John_Aubrey "wikilink") noted that [William
Laud](William_Laud "wikilink"), the [Archbishop of
Canterbury](Archbishop_of_Canterbury "wikilink") was "a great lover 
of Cats" and "was presented with some Cyprus-cats, i.e. our Tabby-Cats." 
He then claimed that "I doe well remember that the common English Catt, 
was white with some blueish piednesse [i.e. with grey parts]. The race 
or breed of them is now almost lost."  However, most drawings or 
paintings of cats in medieval manuscripts do show them to be tabbies.

## Notable examples

Due to the pattern being expressed by both pure and mixed-breed cats, a
large number of famous cats fall into the "tabby" category. A few of the
most notable examples include:

-   [Think Think](Think_Think_and_Ah_Tsai "wikilink"): one of two cats
    belonging to the President of Taiwan, [Tsai
    Ing-wen](Tsai_Ing-wen "wikilink").
-   The [Ithaca Kitty](Ithaca_Kitty "wikilink"): a grey tabby cat with
    seven toes on each front foot that inspired one of the first
    mass-produced stuffed toys.
-   [Morris the Cat](Morris_the_Cat "wikilink"): an orange tabby who
    began appearing as an advertising mascot for [9Lives cat
    food](9Lives "wikilink") in 1969. Morris became an iconic television
    character in the following decades, being played by three orange
    tabbies since 1968, all rescued from shelters.
-   [Maru](Maru_(cat) "wikilink"): a tabby from Japan, and one of the
    most popular cats in the age of the internet. He once held the
    [Guinness World Record](Guinness_World_Records "wikilink") for the
    most-watched animal on [YouTube](YouTube "wikilink").
-   [Orangey](Orangey "wikilink"): an orange tabby who starred in a
    number of movie and televisions roles. His most notable role was
    that of *Cat* in the 1961 film *[Breakfast at
    Tiffany's](Breakfast_at_Tiffany's_(film) "wikilink")*, for which he
    won his second [PATSY Award](PATSY_Award "wikilink"). He is the only
    cat to win twice, his first win coming in 1951 for
    [*Rhubarb*](Rhubarb_(1951_film) "wikilink").
